# Album-of-the-Week

`Album-of-the-Week` is a a small `MERN` app for my friends and I to use for cataloging and rating albums that we listen to weekly and discuss. It utilizes the Spotify API to add album data to the database.

It is hosted at http://weekly-album.herokuapp.com but may take some time to wake up after sleeping.

Here are some `screenshots` of it in action:
